# Welcome to my Movie Grossings, my mini capstone project!

![](https://i.imgur.com/kq7hrEh.png)
This is one of the projects I did in my Python coursework. It is a very simple project that demonstrates the power of the Seaborn library. It really cut down on the number of lines!

Is there a relationship between movie budget and movie grossing? Let's find out with a little Linear Regression excercise.





## ðŸ›  Tools used in this project
1. Python! (Google Colaboratory)
2. Pandas library
3. Matplotlib library
4. Seaborn library
6. scikit-learn Linear Regression library


## Snippets of the output
